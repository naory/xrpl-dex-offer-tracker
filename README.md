# XRPL DEX Offer Tracker

A full-stack application for tracking offers on the XRPL (XRP Ledger) Decentralized Exchange (DEX).

## Project Overview

This project provides a real-time dashboard and backend service to monitor, display, and analyze offers on the XRPL DEX. It is split into two main components:

- **Client**: A React-based frontend for visualizing DEX offers.
- **Server**: A backend service for fetching, processing, and serving XRPL DEX offer data.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of XRPL DEX offers via WebSocket
- Dynamic multi-pair tracking (configurable via database)
- Comprehensive analytics endpoints:
  - Volume analytics
  - Price trends
  - Order book depth and liquidity
  - Offer counts by currency
  - Orders per account
- Filtering and searching offers by asset, price, and account
- Historical offer analytics and charts
- Responsive, user-friendly dashboard
- PostgreSQL storage with Redis caching
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration tests)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xrpl-dex-offer-tracker.git
   cd xrpl-dex-offer-tracker
   ```

2. Start PostgreSQL and Redis:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Initialize databases:
   ```bash
   # Initialize test database
   ./server/init_test_db.sh
   
   # Initialize main database
   ./server/init_main_db.sh
   ```

4. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm install
   cd ../server && npm install
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using the start script (recommended)
   cd server
   ./start.sh testnet   # For testnet (default)
   ./start.sh mainnet   # For mainnet

   # Option 2: Using npm scripts
   cd server
   npm run dev      # For testnet
   npm run mainnet  # For mainnet
   ```

6. Start the frontend client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Server Startup: Offer Backfill with XRPL HTTP API

To ensure the server has a complete and up-to-date view of all current offers for tracked pairs, the server performs a backfill on startup using the XRPL HTTP API.

### Motivation
- If the server only listens to new XRPL transactions, it may miss offers created before it started.
- Backfilling ensures the database is in sync with the XRPL ledger for all tracked pairs.

### How It Works
1. **For each tracked pair:**
    - Query the XRPL HTTP API (e.g., using the `book_offers` method) for all current offers.
    - Paginate if necessary (the XRPL API may limit results per call).
2. **For each offer:**
    - Upsert the offer into the `offers` table in the database.
    - Optionally, record a backfill event in `offer_history` (or just ensure the current state is correct).
3. **After backfill:**
    - The server starts listening for new transactions as usual.

### Best Practices
- Log progress and errors during backfill.
- Run backfill before starting the websocket listener to avoid race conditions.
- Optionally, use a "backfill in progress" flag to avoid serving incomplete data during startup.
- Make backfill idempotent (safe to run multiple times).

### Example Pseudocode
```js
async function backfillOffersForTrackedPairs(pool, trackedPairs) {
  for (const pair of trackedPairs) {
    let marker = null;
    do {
      const response = await xrplApi.book_offers({
        taker_gets: pair.taker_gets,
        taker_pays: pair.taker_pays,
        marker,
        limit: 200 // or whatever the API allows
      });
      for (const offer of response.offers) {
        // Upsert into DB
        await upsertOffer(pool, offer);
      }
      marker = response.marker;
    } while (marker);
  }
}
```

## API: In-Memory Top-K Trading Pairs (Real-Time)

The backend exposes several endpoints for real-time analytics of the most traded pairs over the past 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours. These endpoints are powered by an in-memory tracker (easy to refactor to Redis if needed).

### Endpoints

#### `GET /top-trading-pairs`
Returns the top-k most traded pairs for a given time window.

**Query Parameters:**
- `window`: Time window (`10m`, `1h`, or `24h`). Default: `24h`
- `k`: Number of pairs to return. Default: `20`

**Example:**
```
GET /top-trading-pairs?window=1h&k=5
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "window": "1h",
  "k": 5,
  "pairs": [
    {
      "pairKey": "...",
      "takerGets": { "currency": "XRP", "issuer": null },
      "takerPays": { "currency": "USD", "issuer": "r..." },
      "volume": 12345.67,
      "count": 42,
      "lastUpdate": 1723456789012
    }
    // ...
  ],
  "timestamp": 1723456789012
}
```

#### `GET /trading-stats`
Returns comprehensive stats for all time windows, including memory usage.

**Query Parameters:**
- `k`: Number of pairs to return per window. Default: `20`

**Example:**
```
GET /trading-stats?k=10
```

#### `GET /pair-stats/:currency1/:currency2`
Returns stats for a specific trading pair.

**Query Parameters:**
- `issuer1`: (optional) Issuer for currency1
- `issuer2`: (optional) Issuer for currency2

**Example:**
```
GET /pair-stats/XRP/USD?issuer2=rhub8VRN55s94qWKDv6jmDy1pUykJzF3wq
```

#### `GET /trading-pairs/realtime`
Returns a formatted list of top-k pairs for a given window, with rank and readable fields.

**Query Parameters:**
- `window`: Time window (`10m`, `1h`, or `24h`). Default: `24h`
- `k`: Number of pairs to return. Default: `20`

**Example:**
```
GET /trading-pairs/realtime?window=10m&k=3
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "window": "10m",
  "k": 3,
  "pairs": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "pair": "XRP/USD",
      "volume": 1000.0,
      "count": 5,
      "lastUpdate": 1723456789012,
      "currency1": "XRP",
      "currency2": "USD",
      "issuer1": null,
      "issuer2": "r..."
    }
    // ...
  ],
  "totalPairs": 10,
  "timestamp": 1723456789012
}
```

**Note:** These endpoints are powered by an in-memory tracker. If you want persistence or distributed state, you can refactor the tracker to use Redis with minimal changes.
